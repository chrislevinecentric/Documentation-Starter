## Design Guidelines

Allows the user to alternate between related views while remaining in the same context.

* Tabs serve as a navigational aid for users to browse information within the same context of a webpage.
* Maintaining the user's context within the page is the primary purpose of Tabs. It is crucial to avoid redirecting users to different pages when they interact with Tabs.
* Tabs should contain content that is thematically connected, ensuring that users have an idea of what to anticipate when exploring each Tab.
* It is important to prevent users from continuously switching between Tabs to accomplish a task.
* Tab labels should be brief, easily scannable, and provide a clear description of their contents. It is advisable to avoid lengthy labels or the use of icons.
* To prevent cognitive overload and maintain a clean user interface, it is best to limit the number of Tabs to no more than six.
* Tabs should directly correspond to the relevant section of the page in which they are located.
* The divider line of a Tab should extend across the entire width of its container, creating a distinct separation between the Tab sections and the rest of the page.


* Tabs should not be relied upon as the primary means of navigation.



## When to use

* When content can be grouped into logical sections in order to avoid overwhelming the user with a lot of information.


* Use Tabs to help section off and organize related content.



## When to use something else

* If you need to view information from multiple Tabs at the same time, it is advisable to explore an alternative solution.
* Tabs are not ideal for comparing information or data because they require users to rely on their short-term memory when switching between Tabs.
* When there is a requirement for more than 6 or 7 Tabs, it is recommended to use a more noticeable and alternative navigation method.


* It is advisable to avoid using Tabs within a card user interface (UI).
