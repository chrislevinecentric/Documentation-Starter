## Design Guidelines

Tables are an efficient way of displaying sets of repeating data with the same structure.

* Data Tables are designed to exhibit data that can be conveniently examined and compared.


* In essence, every row within a Table symbolizes an item, and each individual cell in that row denotes an attribute of said item.
* Consequently, all the cells within a specific column will share the same data type, such as dates, numbers, text, and so on.
* Ideally, each cell should contain a single value, while the use of field sets is not recommended.
* The use of Nested Tables is strongly discouraged.

## When to use

Use tables to allow users to:

* Easily scan and compare data


* View and edit data
* Manipulate and navigate through a large amount of data
* Preview data

## When to use something else

* You only have a small data set.


* A more detailed amount of information needs to be displayed by default.
* There is more than one piece of information within a cell.
