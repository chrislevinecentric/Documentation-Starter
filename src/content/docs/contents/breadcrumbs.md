## Design Guidelines

Breadcrumbs serve as a supplementary navigation tool enabling users to effortlessly track and retain a clear sense of their location while navigating across various pages, folders, or files.

* Breadcrumbs assist users in maintaining their location and orientation while navigating through the hierarchical structure of a website's information. 


* They should be employed as a supplementary tool to the primary or main navigation, rather than as a replacement. 
* Every breadcrumb trail begins with a root page, from which subsequent pages can be traced back. 
* The utilization of breadcrumbs enables users to easily backtrack and jump to previous pages when needed.

## When to use

Utilize an Accordion in situations where a substantial amount of information needs to be displayed on a page, while allowing certain specifics to remain initially hidden.

## When to use something else

Exercise caution when concealing vital information or adding an additional click for users who are expected to peruse all the content. It is possible that content concealed in a collapsed state may go unread or unnoticed by users right away.
