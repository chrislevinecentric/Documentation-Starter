Breadcrumbs serve as a supplementary navigation tool enabling users to effortlessly track and retain a clear sense of their location while navigating across various pages, folders, or files.

## Annotations

1. **Root Page**: The root page grounds the trail as users navigate to subsequent pages.
2. **Breadcrumb Pages**: Each page has its own label and becomes clickable.
3. **Current Page**: All users should be aware of which page they are currently viewing. It is not clickable.

## Design Guidelines

* Breadcrumbs assist users in maintaining their location and orientation while navigating through the hierarchical structure of a website's information. 
* They should be employed as a supplementary tool to the primary or main navigation, rather than as a replacement. 
* Every breadcrumb trail begins with a root page, from which subsequent pages can be traced back. 
* The utilization of breadcrumbs enables users to easily backtrack and jump to previous pages when needed.

**Placement**:

* Breadcrumbs are a navigation aid displayed as a series of links positioned at the top left of a page, below the header but above the page title.
* It is important to ensure that the position of Breadcrumbs remains consistent and fixed as users navigate through various pages.

## When to use

* Use Breadcrumbs for intricate site navigation requirements.
* Use Breadcrumbs for monitoring hierarchical navigation.

## When to use something else

* Consider utilizing alternative components for primary navigation. Breadcrumbs serve as a supplementary feature for global or primary navigation.
* If your hierarchy is flat and consists of only 1 or 2 levels, it may be advisable to remove the use of Breadcrumbs entirely.
