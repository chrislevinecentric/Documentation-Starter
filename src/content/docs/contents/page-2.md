## Design Guidelines

Accordions allow users to toggle between displaying and hiding content within a collapsible container. It's commonly used to manage information in a structured and space-efficient manner



* This feature emphasizes key elements within a section and unveils additional content when users interact with the header portion of the container. 


* By allowing users to toggle the visibility of information, it ensures that the design stays pertinent and aligned with their expectations. 
* Prioritizing the scanning of essential details enhances processing efficiency while maintaining the ability to access supplementary information.



## When to use

Utilize an Accordion in situations where a substantial amount of information needs to be displayed on a page, while allowing certain specifics to remain initially hidden.

## When to use something else

Exercise caution when concealing vital information or adding an additional click for users who are expected to peruse all the content. It is possible that content concealed in a collapsed state may go unread or unnoticed by users right away.
