## Design Guidelines

Buttons highlight actions available on a screen.

* Actions should be clearly indicated by buttons.


* Buttons should be easily noticeable, identifiable, and specific.
* Ensure that buttons appear and behave in a way that suggests they can be clicked.
* Icons can be used alone or positioned to the left or right of the label. When utilized, the icon should convey the purpose of the button.
* In crowded environments or when space is limited, consider using buttons with only icons.
* To clarify ambiguous icons for everyone, include accessible tooltips alongside icon-only buttons.
* When selecting a button, take into account the action's priority and how much visual emphasis the button should have within the context of the page it will be placed on.
* Make deliberate choices and refer to the provided examples to determine the most suitable button for your specific use case.

## When to use something else

Use Hyperlinks within a paragraph to navigate to another page.
