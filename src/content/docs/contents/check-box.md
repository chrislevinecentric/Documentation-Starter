* Each Checkbox corresponds to a specific value. The label for each selection should concisely describe the choice. For more information on writing Checkbox labels, refer to the provided guidelines.

## When to use

Utilize checkboxes when users can choose none, one, or multiple options from a predetermined list containing seven or fewer choices.

## When to use something else

* If you only have two choices, yes or no, you may want to use a Radio Button. 
* When you have a list of options ranging from 2 to 7, it's advisable to utilize Radio Buttons or a Select to allow users to choose a single option. However, if you have a large or unknown number of list items, employing a Prompt would be beneficial. 
* Prompts offer search capabilities and folders, providing users with the ability to browse through options. Additionally, Prompts can be configured to support either single or multi-select functionality.



## Additional Information 



* Form Field Labels are written in title case.
* The Checkbox Label for each individual selection are kept as concise as possible and written in sentence case.
