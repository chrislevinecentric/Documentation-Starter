## Design Guidelines

* The positioning of the Form Field Label can be in two ways: above or to the left of the checkbox group in LTR languages. In RTL languages, the Form Field Labels are aligned to the right of the checkbox group.


* For LTR languages, Checkbox Labels are placed to the right of the Checkboxes, while in RTL languages, they are positioned to the left of the Checkboxes.
* Checkboxes enable users to choose one or multiple options. Selected options are visually represented by a white check with a blue fill. Clicking on a selected option again will deselect it.
* Each Checkbox corresponds to a specific value. The label for each selection should concisely describe the choice. For more information on writing Checkbox labels, refer to the provided guidelines.

## When to use

Utilize checkboxes when users can choose none, one, or multiple options from a predetermined list containing seven or fewer choices.

## When to use something else

* If you only have two choices, yes or no, you may want to use a Radio Button. 


* When you have a list of options ranging from 2 to 7, it's advisable to utilize Radio Buttons or a Select to allow users to choose a single option. However, if you have a large or unknown number of list items, employing a Prompt would be beneficial. 
* Prompts offer search capabilities and folders, providing users with the ability to browse through options. Additionally, Prompts can be configured to support either single or multi-select functionality.
