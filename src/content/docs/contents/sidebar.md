## Design Guidelines

Sidebar/drawers are containers that anchor to the left or right side of the screen.

* The content within a page can be pushed and resized by Side Panels as it expands, or the panels can float over the page content.


* To enhance interactivity and accessibility for the Side Panel, utilize a Tooltip when utilizing the Expand/Collapse Button. The Tooltip provides additional guidance that the icon is interactive. When the Side Panel is expanded, the tooltip text will display "Collapse," and when it is collapsed, the tooltip will show "Expand."

## When to use

While the components within a Side Panel can be extensively customized to accommodate different scenarios, they are frequently employed in the following manners:

**Main navigation**

* It is commonly collapsible but not removable, ensuring the panel remains visible on the page and cannot be closed.



**Drawer**

* When Panels are displayed above an overlay, the user's ability to interact with the main page is disabled. The overlay is intended to draw the user's attention to the Panel's contents, creating an optimal environment for advanced navigation, editing, or displaying supplementary information while minimizing any potential distractions.


* A Side Panel that appears over an overlay features a close button, but does not offer a collapse option. By activating the close button, both the Panel and the overlay are closed, allowing the user to refocus on the main page.
