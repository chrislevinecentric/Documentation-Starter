Pagination enables users to easily explore extensive content or data that is distributed across multiple pages, ensuring visibility of additional pages.

1. **Navigational Controls**: Allow users to navigate through available pages.
2. **Page Numbers**: Each page has its own page number
3. **Additional Details**: Communicates the number of pages and total number of items. Page numbers are separated by an en dash. The word “pages” is customizable.

## Design Guidelines

* Pagination is a flexible navigation feature that consists of the following components:

  * **Page Numbers**: These elements give users an understanding of their current page in relation to other pages.
  * **Page Navigation**: Navigational controls enable users to move backward or forward through pages. When applicable, they can also jump to the first or last page.
  * **Numeric Input**: This feature allows users to directly access a particular page.
  * **Label**: The label communicates the total number of pages and the overall number of items. The term "items" can be customized as per requirements.
* Pagination is commonly used in conjunction with tables.
* In responsive scenarios, pagination simplifies to its fundamental components, namely left/right controls and the current page number.

## When to use

* Breaking down extensive amounts of data or content into smaller segments.
* Enhancing the loading speed and performance of a system.
* Reducing the overwhelming nature of data/content for users.
* Enabling easy navigation and page retrieval for all users.
* Displaying the total number of pages and returned results for content.

## Best Practices

* Include a variety of options to facilitate user navigation between pages. It is recommended to offer multiple choices such as Previous/Next controls and a Numeric Input. 
* Additionally, make sure to prominently display the Current Page to provide users with a clear sense of their position in relation to other pages.
