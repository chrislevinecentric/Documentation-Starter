## Design Guidelines

Tooltips reveal contextual information about an element on hover.

* Tooltips offer pertinent and informative details regarding an element.


* They appear when a user hovers over or engages with the associated element.
* The text within tooltips ought to be descriptive while remaining concise and succinct.
* Tooltips must consistently be positioned adjacent to the connected element. The specific placement of the tooltip will depend on the element's location relative to the screen's edge.

## When to use

* Use a tooltip when you want to display additional information for users to better understand the purpose, context, or interaction.


* Use Tooltips to help users differentiate between similar elements.

## When to use something else

When the visual text will be the exact same as what is visually displayed to the user without the tooltip being visible

* Does this element need additional context or information?

  * No: Don't use a tooltip
