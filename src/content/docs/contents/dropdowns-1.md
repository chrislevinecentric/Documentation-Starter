## Design Guidelines

Dropdown allows users to choose one option from a list of items in a Menu.

* Interacting with a Select activates the Menu, whether by clicking or tapping.
* The Menu options need to be arranged in a coherent sequence, either alphabetically, chronologically, or based on their significance.

## When to use

Dropdown work best when the list is between 7 to 15 items to prevent overwhelming the user with too many options.

## When to use something else

* Consider using a Radio Button if the only options are yes or no.
* For a list between 2 to 7 predefined options, consider using a Radio Button to select one option or Checkboxes to select multiple options. Radio and Checkbox groups display all options upfront and do not require the user to interact with the input to view the list of options.
