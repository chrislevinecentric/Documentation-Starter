## Annotations

![](/text-field.svg)

1. **Label:** Title of the Text Area.
2. **Placeholder/Body Text:** Placeholder text is optional and shows an example of how the text is used.
3. **Close (x) Icon:** Lets the user delete text area. Usually pops up when in an error state. 

## Design Guidelines

* Text inputs are limited to accepting words, numbers, and characters.
* Standard and wide text inputs do not support images or text formatting.
* When a user interacts with a non-disabled input or label, such as clicking into it, a text cursor will appear, allowing the user to enter text. As the user types in the text input, their input replaces the placeholder text.

## When to use

A text input is commonly utilized as a form component for gathering user data, which can consist of words, numbers, or characters.

## When to use something else

* Utilize a Text Area when you require users to input a longer amount of text spanning beyond a single line.
* If there are predefined data options that users should not manually input, it is advisable to employ a Select, Radio, or Checkboxes.
