## Design Guidelines

Notifications are messages designed to relay information to the user. There are three types of notifications: banner notifications, actionable notifications, and toast notifications

* **Banner Notification:**

  * Banner notifications are utilized within task flows to inform users about the progress or status of an action or system. Typically, they are displayed at the top of the primary content area or in proximity to the specific item that requires attention.
* **Toast Notification:**

  * Toasts are time-based  that are non-modal they tend to present brief messages. Typically, they appear at the top right of the screen and automatically vanish after a few seconds.



* **Toast Notification:**

  * Actionable notifications enable the inclusion of interactive components within a notification, resembling the style of either inline or toast notifications. In the case of actionable notifications, only a single action is permitted per notification. This action often guides users to a relevant task or page associated with the message, allowing them to address the notification.
