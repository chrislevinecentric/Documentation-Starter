## Design Guidelines

Modals are interactive pop-ups reserved for situations which require immediate attention.

* Modals provide a means to input data or notify users on a specific page once an action has been triggered, demanding prompt attention.

## When to use

* Utilize Modals to promptly collect user input while preventing interaction with the rest of the page.


* Use Modals when the alert content and text exceed the capacity of a regular Toast or Pop-up notification.

## When to use something else

* Avoid using Modals for delivering easily accessible links or brief messages that can be swiftly dismissed (instead, use Toasts )

  Refrain from using Modals to showcase information that is intricate or dense, such as Tables or Multi-View Containers.

  If you need to convey the status or confirmation of the application process to the user, consider using a Toast.
