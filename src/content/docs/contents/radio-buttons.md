1. **Form Field Label:** Functions as a header.
2. **Radio Button:** Radio Buttons are aligned close to its label or by itself in some cases.
3. **Radio Button Label:** Radio Button Labels give information about what to select or unselect.

## Design Guidelines

* You have the option to set one Radio Button in the group as the default selection. It is recommended to choose the default option that poses the least risk to the user or is commonly selected.
* In cases where the user is allowed to not select any of the options, you should include a "None" option.
* If the provided list of options does not cover all possible values within seven or fewer options, you should include a Radio Button labeled as "Other."

## When to use

Use Radio Buttons when a user is only allowed to select 1 value from a list of 7 or less options.

## When to use something else

* Consider utilizing Checkboxes or a Select input when allowing a user to choose zero, one, or multiple values from a predetermined list containing seven options or fewer. 
* In cases where the list size is either large or unknown, it is advisable to employ Prompts. Prompts offer search functionality and folder organization, enabling users to browse through available choices.
