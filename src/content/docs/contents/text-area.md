## Design Guidelines

Text Areas enable users to input and edit text across multiple lines.

* When you require users to input longer text that spans beyond a single line, utilize the Text Area component.


* To prevent overwhelming users, limit the number of Wide Text Areas to a maximum of two per page.
*  For all Text Areas on the web, when a user interacts with an enabled field or label, the text cursor will appear, enabling users to enter text. As users type in the Text Area, their input replaces the initial placeholder text.

## When to use

Utilize the Text Area for accommodating lengthier text explanations, typically spanning approximately one paragraph.

## When to use something else

Use a Text Input for a single line of text.
