Badges serve the purpose of visually marking items on a page to facilitate swift identification. They come in two variations: static, non-editable pills, as well as interactive ones. These pills empower users to input a segment, apply filters to a list or table, or add labels to aid in scanning and organizing information.

## Annotations

2. **3. Icon:** (Optional) Displayed before the Pill label to provide an additional supporting visual. Icons displayed after the label are reserved for Removable Pills to further convey the action. For Removable Pills, the icon becomes the click or touch target.

## When to use something else

Exercise caution when concealing vital information or adding an additional click for users who are expected to peruse all the content. It is possible that content concealed in a collapsed state may go unread or unnoticed by users right away.
