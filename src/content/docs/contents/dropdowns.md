Modals are interactive pop-ups reserved for situations which require immediate attention.

## Annotations

![](/modal.svg)

1. **Heading** : Heading should display the title of the content or task.
2. **Body**: Modals contain many different types of content in the body. Typical types of content include media, alerts, dialogs, and/or task-oriented flows.
3. **Close “X” Icon**: Users must be able to intentionally dismiss a modal. This icon inherits styling and interactions from our Tertiary Icon-Only Button Variant.
4. **In-line Buttons** : Action should be at the bottom of the container when used. There are multiple alignments available for use; Left (Default), Center, Full Width & Full Width Stacked, or Right aligned.

## Design Guidelines

* Modals provide a means to input data or notify users on a specific page once an action has been triggered, demanding prompt attention.

## When to use

* Utilize Modals to promptly collect user input while preventing interaction with the rest of the page.
* Use Modals when the alert content and text exceed the capacity of a regular Toast or Pop-up notification.

## When to use something else

* Avoid using Modals for delivering easily accessible links or brief messages that can be swiftly dismissed (instead, use Toasts )

  Refrain from using Modals to showcase information that is intricate or dense, such as Tables or Multi-View Containers.

  If you need to convey the status or confirmation of the application process to the user, consider using a Toast.

## Additional Information

* Phrase confirmations as yes or no questions.
* In the title of the dialog, be clear about what will happen if the user continues. (“Delete software request?”)
* Supplemental text should provide more information, not just reword the title.
* The language should be approachable and clear. Try reading your message out loud, and if it sounds unnatural to say, try rewriting.
