## Design Guidelines

Dropdown allows users to choose one option from a list of items in a Menu.

* Interacting with a Select activates the Menu, whether by clicking or tapping.


* The Menu options need to be arranged in a coherent sequence, either alphabetically, chronologically, or based on their significance.

## When to use

Utilize an Accordion in situations where a substantial amount of information needs to be displayed on a page, while allowing certain specifics to remain initially hidden.

## When to use something else

Exercise caution when concealing vital information or adding an additional click for users who are expected to peruse all the content. It is possible that content concealed in a collapsed state may go unread or unnoticed by users right away.
